## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by [Nam Sung Kim](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/nskim). My research focuses on optimizing data center performance through Hardware-software co-design, with a emphasis on intra-server networks, SmartNICs, and network stack acceleration. Before joining UIUC in 2023, I received my undergraduate degree in computer science from Georgia Tech, where I worked with [Alexandros Daglis](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~adaglis3/) on SmartNIC-driven load balancing and network optimization for microsecond-scale RPCs.
